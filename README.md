# Developer Lessons App

## Inspiration
Have you ever wanted a place to store your most important learnings as a developer as a reminder for when you find yourself going astray? 

## What it does
Provides a place to add, favourite and delete important lessons from your developer journey. Toggles for views with favourites separated (or not separated) from the list, as well as two colour themes, are also provided. There are 7 lessons pre-loaded on the site. Any learnings you add/delete/favourite will be updated and stored in your browser's local storage.

## How we built it
React JS using local storage. 

## Challenges I ran into
In development until I debugged it, the nature of state meant that upon site refresh the page would load 'one step behind'. This is now fixed, so the latest action you take on the site will be saved and reloaded appropriately on the next page refresh. 

## Accomplishment that I'm particularly proud of
Making a project that uses local storage in the browser as the only data storage option. Of course, there are pros and cons to this, but it was a good test of my ability to pick up new concepts.

## What I learned
I used it as an opportunity to practice working with local storage, grids, colour themes and various React best practices including functional components, hooks, props, and maintaining a neatly organised file-base.

## What's next?
For the next game I make, I'd like to learn more about unit collision between two html elements (other than the cursor). For example, in a football game if a player runs into the ball.
