# Project summary
This is a resource I wanted to build for me to store learnings I've had as a developer, quickly set up using local storage so others can use it too. 

I used it as an opportunity to practice working with local storage, grids, filters and various React best practices including functional components, hooks, props, and maintaining a neatly organised file-base.

# Information storage
There are 7 lessons pre-loaded on the site. Any learnings you add/delete/favourite will be updated and stored in your browser's local storage.


# Deployment
I deployed this on Vercel. https://developer-lessons-react.vercel.app/
