    <div>This is a resource I wanted to build for me to store learnings I've had as a developer, quickly set up using local storage so others can use it too. I used it as an opportunity to practice working with local storage, grids, filters and various React best practices including functional components, hooks, props, and maintaining a neatly organised file-base.
